The following is a list of tools needed if the DR/GEM stuff is to be recompiled
in it's current state. The list may not be complete as it is just a reference listing I made while trawling through the files. Some of the Tools are available,
but others will take ingenuity to find. It would be nice if those with contacts
at the various copyright holders, could get some leeway to allow copies to be posted
for us to use. Also is there anybody out there, who used to work on GEM at DR who 
can remember, even vaguely, what was in the DR main server .CFG .PRO & .INI files for these tools.
enjoy
