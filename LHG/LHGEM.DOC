LHGEM is a DOS UMB loader that will allow existing applications running under
Digital Research's GEM 3.x, to free up to 150k of extra DOS program memory.
The program is designed for i286(drdos), 386/486(ms/drdos) using EMM386.EXE  

By loading all or part of the GEM system into this upper memory area, frees 
up conventional memory (below 640k) normally divided between DOS, GEM, apps, 
accessories, fonts and other system data structures.

The result - less swapping to disk, faster re-draws, better font cacheing etc.

This is even more apparent when desktop accessories are loaded. With the GEM 
AES & VDI loaded in the upper memory area, GEM Paint 2.0 can have a full page 
available in VGA 800x600 16 color mode, not possible otherwise.

The use of this program requires either a light technical understanding of 
MS-DOS/ DR-DOS upper memory managment or in the absence of - some patience. 

Overview 
--------
The upper memory address area is normally reserved for expansion such as bios 
support, and option cards typically claiming memory space in 4-64k blocks.

These addresses usually occur from c000hex to ffffhex (the system rom area). 
Space is not required by those acessory cards can be turned into extra usable 
dos memory - sort of for memory resident utilities or programs data etc. 

The trick is to have your expansion options memory usage arranged in a 
contiguous order so as to maximize the left over address space (below the 
1meg boundry) can be remapped for use via EMM386.EXE on MSDOS/DRDOS 5 & up. 

With no accessory cards most 386/486 machines using MSDOS emm386.exe with the
LIM EMS function disabled will make up to 155k of upper memory area available.
This figure is somewhat less for DRDOS because some system data resides there.

Also these results may also be influenced by the system bios's manufacturer.

Caveats
-------
Since the GEM runtime code is loaded only after your DOS boots, it is necessary 
that any other use of the upper memory area be determined at boot time before
GEM is running or is shelled to dos. No other external programs or TSR's should 
be allocating or de-allocating upper memory blocks. Upon GEM'S final exit to DOS
a check with MEM.EXE will show that upper memory is available but, fragmented.

Not a real problem as DOS de-fragments as required for subsequent loadhighs.
Rebooting will make the upper memory area contiguous again. 

When shelling to a dos prompt via GEM desktop's 'Enter Dos Commands' attempting
to run some older pre-msdos5 programs or utilites, may produce an insufficient
memory error, even if chkdsk.exe and mem.exe says there is. The preferred way 
to run external programs is by using the 'install application' menu item and 
choosing the 'DOS' & 'needs full memory' options (see your GEM desktop manual). 

LHgem may or may not work reliably under a windows dos shell. 
The primary objective is to free DOS memory for GEM applications.



Installation
------------
The software comes pre assembled and ready to go for a generic desktop install.
If you wish to re-assemble & link you must run LCONFIG.EXE the first time or
to subsequently customize it afterwards. 

You may alter, re-assemble & link the LHGEM, HIGEM & LHCONFIG sources as long 
as you do not remove the copyright messages. 

LHMAKE.BAT (for masm & link) is provided for your convenience.



Implementation
--------------
(Refer to your DOS manual for the following software drivers if needed.) 

EMM386.EXE - supplied with MS/DRDOS 5.x/ 6.x on 80386 & up based machines.
HIDOS.SYS  - supplied with DRDOS 5.x/ 6.x on 80286 based machine.*

*depending on system board support of shadow ram.	


Example setups for emm386.exe/ hidos.sys for upper memory configuration.. 
the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file might look like this:

EMM386.EXE /NOEMS		- for MSDOS 5.x/ MSDOS 6.x  w/ 80386 & up
EMM386.EXE /EMSALL		- for DRDOS 5.x/ DRDOS 6.x  w/ 80386 & up
HIDOS.SYS /CHIPSET=EMSALL	- DRDOS 5.x/ DRDOS 6.x  w/some 80286 machines.

Save copies of your config.sys and autoexec.bat on a bootable floppy.
After modifing your config.sys & autoexec.bat - reboot.
Use the MEM.EXE command to view the entire memory map. 
Since this command has several options - consult your dos reference.

The following figures are based on MEM.EXE'S amount of FREE upper memory figure.

if =>  80k - GEM.EXE/ GEM.RSC   + allocated data can reside there. (about 78k)
if => 130k - the entire GEM AES + allocated data can reside there.   
if => 150k - the entire GEM AES + a desk accessory can reside there.

Put a copy of LHgem.exe to the GEM system subdirectory  -  \gemapps\gemsys  
If this subdirectory does not exist, you do not have a standard installation. 

Modify this line in GEM.BAT as follows .......(after saving original of course) 

default line :  gemvdi desktop %1 %2 %3	
change to ...:  gemvdi desktop %1 %2 %3 -LHGEM.EXE    ( -HIGEM.EXE for DR-DOS )

Save the changed batch file and run it.
if all goes well, the GEM DESKTOP should be running.
from the DESKTOP'S menu select "Enter Dos Commands" to shell to a DOS prompt. 

type MEM.EXE /d/p  [enter] ...... for MS-DOS 5/6   
type MEM.EXE /a/p  [enter] ...... for DR-DOS 5/6 

Hopefully, if all went well you will see the areas of upper memory occupied
by the GEMVDI.EXE, GEM.EXE, GEM.RSC and most or all off it's components, 
whatever does not fit will automatically be loaded into the lower 640k.

Type EXIT to return to GEM 

IF you repeat this test with your original GEM.BAT startup file you can make 
a before and after evaluation - I think you will be pleased with the results. 

A supplied GEM accessory, FREEMEM.ACC  can be used for this purpose while in 
the desktop environment.
