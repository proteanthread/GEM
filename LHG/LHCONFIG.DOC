                                 for use with

===============================================================================

LHGEM.EXE and HIGEM.EXE are default configured for a standard GEM 3.x system.

If your system is not a standard GEM 3.x installation, the LHconfig.EXE 
configuration program is included as part of the LHgem package. It will allow 
you to configure LHgem.exe (MS-DOS) or HIgem (DR-DOS) to find a chosen default 
GEM *.app (usually the GEM Desktop) at startup.

This program has been tested with the following 3rd party applications..

PerForm......... by Delrina technologies inc.           
Finesse......... by Logitech inc.
Publish-it!..... by Timeworks inc.               
Key Publisher... by Sofkey Software Products.
CCP's Artline... Digital Research & CCP gmbh.(Germany)

If you are using one the above applications, the GEM system software
may be installed using a directory structure specific to that application.


\gemapps		location for the GEM *.app program files
\gemapps\gemsys 	location for GEM system files including GEMVDI.EXE 
			and GEM'S desktop.app, the only APP loaded by default.
			(LHgem & HIgem are pre-configured for this setup.)


For example, if you have Key publisher installed you might see..


\keypub			location for keypub.app - desktop publishing program.
\keypub\gemsys		location for GEM system files including GEMVDI.EXE.  


To configure LHgem/HIgem for the above example..
------------------------------------------------
LHgem.exe, HIgem.exe and LHapp.exe must all be located in the same directory.
At the DOS prompt, enter the following commands.. 


LHCONFIG \keypub\keypub.app	then follow the menu instructions.	


After LHconfig is finished copy LHgem.exe (MS-DOS) or HIgem.exe (DR-DOS) 
to the GEMSYS subdirectory, this example assumes you are on drive C..


C:> copy lhgem.exe \keypub\gemsys	(then press enter.)


Using Publish-it as an example
------------------------------
Before editing your startup batch file, keypub.bat might looks like this..

cd \keypub\gemsys
gemvdi \keypub\keypub.app


After editing, your startup batch file (keypub.bat) looks like this..


cd \keypub\gemsys
gemvdi \keypub\keypub.app -LHGEM.EXE            ( -LHGEM or LHGEM.EXE - ok)


This example can be extended to other non-standard GEM installations.
At this point, you can resume reading where you left off at the LHgem.doc file.
